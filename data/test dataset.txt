Moreover, the payload termination with `//` indicates an intention to block further processing or comment out trailing contents to ensure execution. This attack affects modern browsers as indicated by the sophisticated User-Agent string used.
Method: [XSS Attack]\nPath: [/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=]\nHost: [10.10.3.128:2280]\nSource IP: [10.122.1.48]\nImportant Header: User-Agent: [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36]\nReferer: [http://10.10.3.128:2280/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=]self['\x65\x76\x61\x6c']('self["\x61\x6c\x65\x72\x74"](self["\x61\x74\x6f\x62"]("WFNT"))');\nDescription: A [cross-site scripting (XSS)] attack has been detected, leveraging encoded JavaScript escape sequences in the URL to obfuscate an [eval()] function call designed to execute an [alert()] on the client's browser. The base64 encoded part "WFNT" translates to ['XSS'], which is a direct hint at the nature of the attack. The attack is initiated via the "Referer" header, showing a high level of sophistication in exploiting browser-based trust mechanisms to execute malicious code.
Method: [XSS Attack]\nPath: [/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=]<eyJpZCI6IjxpbWcgc3JjPXggb25lcnJvcj1hbGVydCgpPiJ9>\nHost: [10.10.3.128:2280]\nSource IP: [10.122.1.48]\nImportant Header: User-Agent: [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36]\nDescription: A [cross-site scripting (XSS)] attack has been identified where the payload is encoded in base64. Upon decoding, it reveals an [HTML img tag] which triggers an [JavaScript alert()] function as an error handling mechanism when the image fails to load (onerror attribute). This exploit is crafted to execute when the target accesses the vulnerable parameter ["name"] within the query. This type of attack aims to test for or exploit client-side input handling vulnerabilities on the web application server.
Method: [XSS Attack]\nPath: [/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=]<malicious payload>\nHost: [10.10.3.128:2280]\nSource IP: [10.122.1.48]\nImportant Header: User-Agent: [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36]\nDescription: A [cross-site scripting (XSS)] attack has been detected where multiple <a> tags are used in the URL to inject JavaScript code. The attacker uses HTML entity encoding and JavaScript obfuscation techniques (such as using HTML entities for "javascript:") to bypass input sanitization filters. The goal is to trigger a JavaScript alert function, demonstrating how an attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in a user’s browser session. This attack is particularly designed to exploit browsers such as Chrome, using comprehensive evasion techniques.
